	<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

		<p>Orignally from Orange, CT, I now reside in Astoria, New York where I live with my beautiful wife and 8 month old daughter. Living in New York City has been nothing short of amazing.  I've met people from around the world and from all walks of life.  Being exposed to this amount of diversity has been an eye opener and a blessing.  Besides the awesome people and food, New York City caters to all of my interests.  From eating exotic food to photographing ordinary street life to surfing cool breaks, NYC has it all for me.</p>
