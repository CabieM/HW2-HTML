		<p>I'm currently enrolled in the Full Stack Web Development course at NY City Tech where I'll learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL.  My hopes are to take what I learn from this course and build out my skills to become highly proficient in web development.  So far, my newly learned skills have enabled me to build this page which you are reading.</p>

		<p>When I am not at NY City Tech or at the Discovery office, you can find me at Rockaway Beach catching gnarly knee high swells or snapping photos somewhere in NYC.</p>
